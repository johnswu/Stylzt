Hi Nikki! Not sure if you remember, but I worked with you on Summer and Osama's short film.  I wanted to invite you to a new site I'm starting up to help people in the creative community network and get gigs.  It's http://www.stylzt.com, and I'm launching the Beta release.  I'd love to hear your feedback on anything I can change or add to make it more useful.  It's being made with you in mind!  Hope you're doing well!
